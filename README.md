# PHPNES

A NES Emulator implemented in PHP, heavily based off of [JSNES](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes) and Jamie Sanders' vNES.

The goal of this project is to be a hilarious NES emulator using [PHP-SDL](https://github.com/phpsdl/extension) for graphical output and user input.

### Current Status

Not fully functional!
