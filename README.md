# Development ceased

Due to a unfortunate switch from arch linux to OSX, I'm unable to install sdl devel lib/headers and compile PHPSDL for Yosemite. ):

Development is ceased unless I make the switch back to Arch Linux on a more supported laptop.

# PHPNES

A NES Emulator implemented in PHP, heavily based off of [JSNES](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes) and Jamie Sanders' vNES.

The goal of this project is to be a hilarious NES emulator using [PHP-SDL](https://github.com/phpsdl/extension) for graphical output and user input.
