# Development ~~ceased~~ resumed!

With some careful configuration, looks like I'm up and running with [PHP-SDL](https://github.com/phpsdl/extension) on OSX 10.10 Yosemite!

# PHPNES

A NES Emulator implemented in PHP, heavily based off of [JSNES](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes) and Jamie Sanders' vNES.

The goal of this project is to be a hilarious NES emulator using [PHP-SDL](https://github.com/phpsdl/extension) for graphical output and user input.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have PECL and Composer. Install `sdl-beta`.

	pecl install sdl-beta

Or if you're more daring, compile PHP-SDL from source!

### Current Status

Not fully functional! Currently porting over JSNES.

### Libraries

[ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp/react)
[PHP-SDL](https://github.com/phpsdl/extension)
